**Text Classification problem to assign a category to text data**

In text classification script, binary class dataset has been used where label is 1 for actual patient and 0 fake patient.
This classification model is build using BERT transformation model. BERT is a pre-trained transformer model developed by Google.

Steps followed:-
1. Load the data
2. Look at the data identify the context of the classes
3. Setup tensorflow 
4. Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
5. Download a pre-trained BERT Model
6. Create preprocess text data and create token
7. Create input pipeline
8. Create classification head and fine tune BERT for text classification
9. Evaluate text classification model
10. Predict the class using the trained model

Accuracy of this model is 87%, this can be increased by increasing number of epochs
(Note:- increase in no. of epochs can also lead to overfitting. Hence it is important to iterate training data for right number of epochs, 
therefore giving a large number as epochs and using "early stop" technique is a common practise to avoid overfitting. 
In this technique, model stop training when the error rate of validation data is minimum.)
The major feature used in this model is "Link" as it cover text in other features of the dataset including "Topic" and "Host".
Another feature that can be considered for the classification is "Source", this can improve the performence by including more context.
