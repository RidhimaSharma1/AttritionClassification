**Linear Classification to classify records into two groups using the features and their relations with target category**

In this classification problem, kaggles titanic dataset has been used. The target variable has categories 0 "Not Survived" and 1 "Survived".
To create this classification data pre processing was required as Linear model does't support categorical or qualitative parameters. 
The features which are considered in this model are - 
a) "Age"
b) "Fare"
c) "Pclass - Ticket class"<br/> d) "SibSp - siblings / spouses aboard" <br/> e) "Parch - parents / children aboard" <br/> f) "Sex - Gender of Passenger"<br/> g) "Embarked - Port of Embarkation"<br/> h) "Fare"<br/>
Steps:- <br/> 1. Load the data <br/> 2. Look at the data, identify and understand the classes<br/> 3. Explore the data (check for null values, realtionship among parameters, data summary, etc.)<br/> 
4. Fix the data, transform it in the usage way <br/> 5. split the data into train and test sets<br/> 6. Select the model, train the model using the data<br/> 
7. Check the model performance<br/> 8. Validate the values using test data<br/> 9. Predict the unseen values using the trained model<br/>
To train this model multiple models has been tried including SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and stacking of Random forest with other models. 
Logistic regression has performed the best with 81% accuracy, hence LR has been used to predict the unseen test data.
