# Classification
HR analytics uses employee data to improve talent management and business outcome.

In this python script, Analytics Vidhya Jobathon dataset has been used to predict the attrition of employees.
In this script we have used classification technique to predict if an employee is likely to leave the company.
The features which has been considered in this model are:
a) Date of Joining
b) City
c) Education Level
d) Gender
e) Quarterly Rating
f) Total Business Value
g) Designation (Joining and current)
h) Age
i) Salary
And date of last working day has been used as the target column (which has been converted into Target of 0 and 1, 
where 0 means person has served the last working day and 1 means employee is still part of the organization)
